          Greater Good Coffee Roasters have made a name for themselves in the coffee culture here in Austin. They originally started in Dripping Springs with their coffee shop/coffee roasting setup and have recently opened up a shop on the East Side. Their warm, well lit, and natual wood building interior is one that is relaxing to come to and they have a Training Lab where you can pay to have a professional Barista show you how to Roast, Pour Latte Art, and pull an espresso shot.

        <h3>Flat Track</h3>
        <p>
          One of my favorite details that I look for in a coffee shop is how Hipster they are because it means that they will have a simple/modern interior. Not only is Flat Track this, but they share a space with a bicycle shop. I love everything about Flat Track and is one that everyone needs to check out while in Austin.
